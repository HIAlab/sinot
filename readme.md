<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
During my master thesis, I am focussing on causal effects in N of 1 studies. Unfortunately there was no library available, which meets my needs. Hence, I created my own library for simulating data in this context to test different methods on it.  

### Built With
This project is build on `python 3.8` and is using following libraries: 
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

For detailed description you can have a look into `requirements.txt`.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Here you can see, how to use the library.

### Prerequisites

Python is required for this package. For that, I used anaconda and created my own environment with in it. 
Afterwards I installed all requirements within this environment with:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```shell
git clone https://github.com/thogaertner/n-of-1-simulation
```
2. Use the python functions within python or shell


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Create Study Parameters
This project consists of 2 functions. The first oen is `creat_study_parameters.py`. It transforms a DAGitty text file into the parameter file.
A DAGitty text file could be found at `./example/dagitty_example.txt`. 

A study parameter file `out.json` could be created by using:
```shell
python create_study_params.py ./example/dagitty_example.txt example/out.json
```

If you need help, you can simply use the option `--help`:
```shell 
python create_study_params.py --help
```

### Simulate Data

To simulate data, you use functions from `simulation.py` to create a cohort based on a parameters file.

```python
sim = Simulation(study_params)
pat_complete, pat_drop = sim.gen_patient(study_design, days_per_period, drop_out=drop_out)
```

A complete example of simulation data could be found in `Simulate_Example.ipynb`.
