<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The project started with a master thesis on analysing causal effects in N of 1 studies. Unfortunately there was no library available, which meets the needs. Hence, this package was created. Within this package, data of N-of-1 studies could be created though a DAG file and a configuration file. A preprint of the related publication could be found on [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.21.22277832v1).

### Built With
This project is build on `python 3.8` and is using following libraries: 
* Numpy
* Pandas
* (Matplotlib)

For detailed description you can have a look into `pyproject.toml`.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Here you can see, how to use the library.

### Prerequisites

Python is required for this package. For that, I used anaconda and created my own environment with in it. 
Afterwards I installed all requirements within this environment with:


### Installation

You can directly install the current version: 
```shell
pip install --upgrade https://github.com/HIAlab/sinot/tarball/master
```

Alternativly, you can clone the repo and install it with binding to the repo.
1. Clone the repo
```shell
git clone https://github.com/thogaertner/n-of-1-simulation
```
2. Install package with pip
```shell
pip install -e path_to_project
```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Create Study Parameters
This project consists of 2 functions. The first one is `create_study_parameters`. It transforms a DAGitty text file into the parameter file.
A DAGitty text file could be found at `./example/parameter/dagitty_example.txt`. 

A study parameter file `out.json` could be created by using:
```shell
python ./src/sinot/create_study_params.py ./example/parameter/dagitty_example.txt ./example/parameter/out.json
```

For further information checkout `--help`.

Alternativly you can directly use the function `create_study_params` from `sinot.create_study_params`. It returns a json file containing all dependencies from your dag with default parameters:

```python
from sinot.create_study_params import create_study_params
dagitty_file = "path_to_your_file"
study_params = create_study_params(dagitty_file)
```

### Simulate Data

To simulate data, you use the class `sinot.Simulation` to create a cohort based on a parameters file.

```python
from sinot.Simulation import Simulation
sim = Simulation(study_params)
pat_complete, pat_drop = sim.gen_patient(study_design, days_per_period, drop_out=drop_out)
```

A complete example of simulation data could be found in `example/Simulate_Example.ipynb`.
